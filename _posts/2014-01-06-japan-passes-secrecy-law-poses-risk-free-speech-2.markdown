Last month [Japan's parliament passed a secrecy law](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/world/asia/japans-parliament-approves-a-secrecy-law-amid-protests.html) which dramatically increases the range of documents that are kept secret in Japan and increases penalties for leaking documents. The law's definition of what constitutes a secret is vague and the law gives government agencies broad latitude in classifying material. The law's broadness and vagueness, and the harsh -- up to 10 years in prison -- penalties that come with it may be used to harass journalists and whistle-blowers.

[Reuters describes these risk as follows](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/24/us-japan-secrecy-idUSBRE99N1EC20131024):  





<blockquote>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government is planning a state secrets act that critics say could curtail public access to information on a wide range of issues, including tensions with China and the Fukushima nuclear crisis.  
....
"Basically, this bill raises the possibility that the kind of information about which the public should be informed is kept secret eternally," Tadaaki Muto, a lawyer and member of a task force on the bill at the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, told Reuters.</blockquote>

 



It seems like this new legislation will crimp free speech and freedom of information in Japan and it comes in the aftermath of America's NSA scandal, which shows the important role that whistle-blowers can have in journalism.
