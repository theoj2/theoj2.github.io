http://news.yahoo.com/twitter-adds-sharing-block-lists-224203264.html
Twitter's new block list feature is very good. Its the perfect fix to idiots on twitter with little potential for abuse. These blocklists are voluntary. In fact, voluntary, user directed filtering is much less abuse prone than its alternative -- the banhammer. If a killfile you got from somewhere is nuking stuff you want to see, just drop it.
