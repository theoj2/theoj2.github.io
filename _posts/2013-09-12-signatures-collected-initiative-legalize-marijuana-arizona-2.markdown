There is a initiative petition in Arizona to legalize marijuana.Its full text can be found on the website of Safer Arizona, the group organizing the initiative. [http://legalizeaz.com/](http://legalizeaz.com/) has a list of locations where signatures are being collected. I have already had the opportunity to sign it

[From an article in the _Arizona Republic_ on the the initiative.](http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20130612personal-experience-spurs-effort-legalize-pot-recreational-use.html)



<blockquote>Dennis Bohlke, the 59-year-old computer programmer who is leading the effort, said the Safer Arizona initiative is modeled after Colorado’s newly enacted law, which taxes and regulates marijuana.

“The intent of the initiative is to legalize marijuana in Arizona and to treat it as we treat alcohol,” said Bohlke.

The effort would amend the state Constitution to allow people 18 and older “to consume or possess limited amounts” of marijuana. The initiative would allow state officials to license grow facilities, marijuana stores and other facilities.

The initiative needs 259,213 valid signatures by July 3, 2014, to qualify for the November 2014 ballot.</blockquote>
