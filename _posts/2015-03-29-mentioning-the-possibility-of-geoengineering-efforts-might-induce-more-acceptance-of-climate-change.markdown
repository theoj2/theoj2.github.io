[A new study published in _Annals of the AAPS_ suggests](http://www.culturalcognition.net/browse-papers/geoengineering-and-the-science-communication-environment-a-c.html) that providing information about the possibility of geoengineering might cause individuals to accept climate change. The authors speculate that it has to do with ideology -- conservatives (or hierarchical-individualists as the paper calls them) tend to put a lot of faith in business and industry, and a conventional presentation of the climate change issue tends to be at least somewhat in opposition to business. Geoengennering uses the tools of industry and thus it might be more palatable to conservatives. That line of reasoning makes me wonder if it was a mistake for activists to emphasize renewable energy as the main alternative to fossil fuels. Nuclear might be more favorable for conservatives. The abstract of the paper reads



<blockquote>We conducted a two-nation study (United States, n = 1500; England, n = 1500) to test a novel theory of science communication. The cultural cognition thesis posits that individuals make extensive reliance on cultural meanings in forming perceptions of risk. The logic of the cultural cognition thesis suggests the potential value of a distinctive two-channel science communication strategy that combines information content (“Channel 1”) with cultural meanings (“Channel 2”) selected to promote open-minded assessment of information across diverse communities. In the study, scientific information content on climate change was held constant while the cultural meaning of that information was experimentally manipulated. Consistent with the study hypotheses, we found that making citizens aware of the potential contribution of geoengineering as a supplement to restriction of CO2 emissions helps to offset cultural polarization over the validity of climate-change science. We also tested the hypothesis, derived from competing models of science communication, that exposure to information on geoengineering would provoke discounting of climate-change risks generally. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that subjects exposed to information about geoengineering were slightly more concerned about climate change risks than those assigned to a control condition.</blockquote>



[SKS' Andy Skuce notes](https://www.skepticalscience.com/kahan-geoeng-polar.html) that their framing of geoengineering is pretty slanted. The article presented to participants is the following.

The techniques vary a lot, but I generally consider geoengineering better than just bearing the costs of severe climate change and adapting, but worse than actually preventing emissions. The other thing is that the most practical/cheapest geoengineering schemes tend to be the ones with the most adverse impacts. I also think that a geoengineering project will be deployed at some point, as I don't see a full mitigation of CO2 emissions happening anything soon with enough strength to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. The scale of the shift in energy infrastructure is on the scale of the investment that happened to fight world war II, and I see no indication that policy makers are willing to commit to that type of investment quickly enough to change things (even though they should).
