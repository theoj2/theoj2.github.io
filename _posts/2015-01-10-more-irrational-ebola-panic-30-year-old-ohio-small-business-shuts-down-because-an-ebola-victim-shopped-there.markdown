[According to the New York Times, a small business bridal store in Ohio has closed its doors](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/us/ebola-store-ohio-bridal-shop-where-ebola-patient-shopped-will-close.html?_r=0) due to public concern due to Ebola. A victim of the virus shopped there while infected but asymptomatic (and therefore non-contagious). [caption id="attachment_1443" align="alignright" width="300"][![Image via CDC.](http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o-300x138.jpg)](http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o.jpg) Image via CDC.[/caption]The store replaced its inventory and conducted an intensive cleaning and when it reopened after the cleaning it had the support of a number of local officials. However, the fact that there was no reasonable threat to the public didn't stop people from avoiding the store because of its Ebola "connection". The sales of the store halved after the re-opening. This store is a victim of a public that does not understand basic science. It is the victim  of irrational paranoia over an extremely rare virus. A basic understand of the facts of medicine would give a typical individual little to fear in such a situation. Only two people have caught the virus in the United States and the clear facts of the biology of the virus show that the infected individual was not contagious. The fact that irrational parinoa destroyed that small business is outrageous.
