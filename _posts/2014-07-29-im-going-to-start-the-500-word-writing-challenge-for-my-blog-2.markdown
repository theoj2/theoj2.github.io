I'm going to write at least 500 words every day for this blog as part of the 500 Word Writing Challenge.   

[http://goinswriter.com/my500words/](http://goinswriter.com/my500words/)





<blockquote> 
The rules:  
Write 500 words per day, every day during the month of January.  
You can write more if you want, but 500 words is the minimum.  
Don’t edit. Just write.  
If you miss a day, pick up where you left off. Don’t make up for lost days.  
Encourage, don’t criticize (unless explicitly invited to do so).  
Blogging counts, but email does not.  
</blockquote>
