![](http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/012115_0533_Meetthe8cha12.jpg)8chan is a forum website where anyone can create a sub forum, or "chan". Its one defining  feature is its friendliness to trolls, and its extremely lax , anything goes moderation policy. Among the more notable members of this community are a large part of the active members of #GamerGate, focused around the /[gamergate](http://8ch.net/gamergate/index.html)/ board. However, there is a much more nefarious board, /[baphomet](http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html)/. That board has the purpose of a clearing house for doxing, harassment, trolling, and hacking. Its members care little for trivial things like ethics. The rules for the board note that "If you have remorse for you're  [sic] actions you are not welcome ….We never show mercy during raids " and  "so if you're a attention whoring faggot this is not the place for you".  /Baphomet/ was founded by trolls and script kiddies saddened by the switch of focus of the hacking group Anonymous towards activism and away from nefarious destruction. Many members of the /gamergate/ chan are also /Baphomet/ users.  There is a close relationship between the two boards. /gamergate/ is the clean board that provides a respectiable public image for GG. /Baphomet/ has become the home for GG dirty tricks. Want to know what GG is really like? Lets  look into /baphomet/ a bit more [http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html](http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html) Note that /baphomet/ is just behind /gamergate/ on the top 25 list of 8chan fora. The top thread is this guy






**_We need to develop beyond ddos and learn how to be a true terror to the SJW [Social Justice Warrior] menace.
_**





**_I'll upload a few of my hacking ebooks here, simply beginnger guides anyone can learn from.
_**





**_Here is a good set of sites to use:

Oooh... Cool. Terrorizing SJWs. Let's open that thread. 






**_>We need to develop beyond ddos  
I agree, OP.  
Doxing, Raiding, and DDOS are fine– but every "battle" we're currently enduring would be over by now if at least some of us knew how to hack/crack/program  
  
Currently, I only know (x)html(5) & css(3). [and some c++, but not enough to really do anything with…]

I would like to be more of a menace to SJWs, but I'm a kidiot loser who doesn't know how to program anything more complex than a VBA macro. Some are making more progress on the whole being criminals thing. 






**_If you haven't noticed, a couple targets got their servers rooted (one hasn't noticed yet) and few got their mail hacked too (most haven't noticed, last time I checked).
_**

The 8chaners hacked the email of some activists trying to voice their opinion. Crushing free speech is something that really warms the heart, doesn't it? 



 





**_You are free to fuck with colleges if you're so inclined. /baphomet/ has no particular cause or position on any given issue besides the position that we should raid people we want to raid because we think it's funny to do so. There have been debates about whether or not we're just pretending like we don't have a purpose, but ultimately it doesn't matter.
_**





**_This is first and foremost a haven for old, even ancient anons who remember what Anonymous was a decade ago and are reviving–as best we can–that same spirit. We are not political in any sense. If /pol/ would like to raid a target, /pol/ ought to raid a target. If it will be particularly funny, they're welcome to come ask us to help out, but if it looks like it's going to be a bore, or if it isn't funny but is simply a matter of supporting an abstract cause, this isn't really the place for it.
_**





**_ ….
_**





**_We don't care about SJWs for the sake of ideology, we raid them because they're easily offended and react with sob stories. That they overwhelmingly are deserving of raids is beside the point.
_**





**_However, if you can find a lelworthy way to fuck with schools, go ahead and share.
_**

We don't really have a mission, other than being criminals that destroy things. 






**_A /baphomet/ take on the LOIC seems like the right way to go, in my opinion.  
If there ever WAS a /baphomet/-endorsed DDoS client, I think it would need to be able to help resolve the common retarded mistakes that occur with planned ddossing; timezones, primary/secondary targets, fallbacks for meetups if everything turns to shit, etc.  
My suggestion would be thus:  
The new LOIC would only be able to function if it was connected to a host, ie the raid leader's own little server, who could update the variables (such as countdown timer, specific URLs, the required number of clients attacking each IP address so maximum DoS occurs across a few places, I dunno…) on people's clients (I'm thinking that the client should be alerted if the leader changes a variable, but they'd have to be edited by the user manually. I don't really want to just surrender my PC to a botnet that could be aimed at ANYTHING…) if/when they changed (by working in conjunction with the driving force of the raid in IRC, ie people from /baphomet/).  
Being able to generate a session should require an additional piece of software to act as a barrier to fucktards, that newfag idiots would be too retarded to find / too shitscared to download if they found it. That would leave the important shit in the hands of people who actually cared about it, while allowing anyone to join the public botnet (but not fire until the countdown timer hit 0 / other parameters were met)  
This would allow widespread advertisement of the raid and new LOIC to anywhere that would listen, generating a large group of people all under the 'guidance' of /baphomet/, or a proxy group such as 4chan's /b/ for max lulz and 0 blame  
Sorry if this makes no sense, I'm slightly very drunk. Anyway, I seem to recall Anonymous using something like this a few years back, but I don't know enough about this shit to be able to pass judgement. Regardless, I think the best way for us to actually advance ourselves as social justice warrior warriors is to gain the (unknowing) support of others.  
Side note, would it be possible to encourage SJWs into ddossing what they thought was 8chan with a program like I suggested, but really have them hit their own shitty sites? We could then post proof to the owners / domain providers for lulz

A closing 8chan rant.
