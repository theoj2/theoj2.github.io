It seems to my like a large part of many left/progressive movements are now undergoing a tendency to put solidarity with others sharing their viewpoints ahead of actual good policy. I have also noted a recent uptick in people from the left who think that attacking another member of the movement (even when he is wrong) is about as bad as opposing it outright.  You see this when members of the femminist community go out of their way to defend toxic members of their community (see this article for an example http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/05/bahar_mustafa_at_goldsmiths_university_ironic_misandry_claims_its_first.html )You see this with environmentalists who wagon circle  on issues like GMOs when the facts indicate that the anti-GMO position is stupid.
