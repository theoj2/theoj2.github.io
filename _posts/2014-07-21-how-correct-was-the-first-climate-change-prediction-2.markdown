_   

[In the last post](https://theojones.name/index.php/arrhenius-and-climate-change/), I discussed the very first research on climate change --- the work of Svante Arrhenius, but how close to modern knowledge did he get? On the relation between CO2 levels and temperature he was quite close. Modern estimates of the climate sensitivity are approximately 3-4.5 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2. The IPCC [says the following](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_synthesis_report.htm) on the issue of climate sensitivity to CO2 increases,it is "likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5째C with a best estimate of about 3째C, and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5째C. Values substantially higher than 4.5째C cannot be excluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as good for those values."

But he was far off on what the impacts of these shifts would be. Unlike Arrhenius, almost all modern researchers would say that the effects of climate change will be gravely harmful.   

Climate change is harmful because human civilization has adapted to a relatively stable climate. A shift away from that climate will be extremely disruptive to humanity. The melting of ice will disrupt infrastructure. Rising temperatures will disrupt agriculture, and will make some crops impossible to grow where they have been grown for centuries. Climate change is also having a vast impact on natural ecosystems. It, along with other human impacts, are bringing forth a fifth mass extinction. A level of disruption to the natural world on par with the KT event that killed the dinosaurs. Ocean acidification will cause further disruption to the natural world, and will harm many species of importance to the seafood industry. The increased prevalence of extremely hot days will have negative impacts on human health.   

Lets go deeper into some of these effects, starting with agriculture. While there are some conditions where some crops may benefit from climate change (for example due to a longer growing season, or increased efficiency of photosynthesis due to more CO2), these positive impacts are almost entirely outweighed by negative counterparts. For many crops climate change will trigger a faster, shorter growth period. This may sound like a good thing but its not. Crops will produce a lot less yield during this fast growth period. All crops have an optimal temperature where they grow the best. Global warming can reduce the area that is available at this optimal climate. Climate change can cause droughts that will reduce the water available for crops. Global warming can also trigger an increase in destructive weather events. The prevalence of pests and parasites will be increased. Many fish critical to the seafood industry favor low temperatures, and will be harmed by global warming. The poorest parts of the world will be hit the hardest by these changes ([http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/agriculture.html](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/agriculture.html)).

And of course he was way off on the situation of how quickly these changes would occur.   

A graph of the real world shift in global temperature is as follows

The shaded regions are the one- and two-standard deviation uncertainties calculated including both statistical and spatial sampling errors. Prior land results from the other groups are also plotted. The NASA GISS record had a land mask applied; the HadCRU curve is the simple land average, not the hemispheric-weighted one.
