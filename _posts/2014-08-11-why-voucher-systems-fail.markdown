[Slate has the following article on Sweeden's school voucher system and its failings](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_dismal_science/2014/07/sweden_school_choice_the_country_s_disastrous_experiment_with_milton_friedman.html).I have a few thoughts on this.

The Slate author seems to be amazed that a generally left-wing country like Sweden could adopt a voucher system.



<blockquote>To the extent that Americans think about Sweden at all, it usually conjures images of gibberish-speaking Muppets, Ikea furniture, and, when it comes to government policies, the welfare state. So it’s something of a surprise that a higher fraction of Swedish students go to privately run (and mostly for-profit) schools than in the U.S.* The system was put in place in the early 1990s by a center-right (by Swedish standards) government,</blockquote>



It doesn't particularly amaze me. Imagine a politician believes all of the following




    
  1. Milton Friedman was right. A privatized education system built around a voucher system is more efficient than a public system. (For reasons why this argument is doubtful in the realm of education read on)

    
  2. Inequality and distributional effects are important.

What would such a politician want to do about education in a) a relatively egalitarian country like Sweden with a strong welfare state, and b) a  relatively unequal economy like that of the U.S

In system _**a)**_ a politician would clearly prefer a voucher system. In economy _**b)**_ such a politician could defend a government centered education system on the grounds of it being a second best option. A system of taxation increases and transfer payments needed to fight inequality directly might be unrealistic. However, privatizing the education system could disproportionately hurt the poor. Keeping the system public would be a good second best option.[ See this link](http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5117.html) for a discussion of how inequality can provoke second best policies.  This situation can be seen in other policy matters such as the minimum wage ([Sweden does not have one](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Minimum_wages_per_hour_in_sweden) [1. It is worth noting that unions are also stronger in that nation]), or [rent controls](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html) (Sweden has them, but to a lesser extent than the U.S).  Because of this trend you would expect support for a voucher system to be higher in Sweden

Now, why doesn't the free market argument of Milton Friedman work for education. Well, markets work efficiently when the goals of three groups are aligned.




    
  1.  The person buying the product

    
  2. The person using the product

    
  3. The public interest



Usually the first two are the same individual, but not so with education. The  parents are the ones buying the product, but not the consumer of the education. There are in fact many cases where the goals of the parents can conflict with the goals of the student. In the United States, I have seen a number of charter schools with a business model built around reducing work for the parent as much as possible. And even if there was no conflict of interest between the student's needs and the parent's needs there may be a conflict with the public interest. The student's interest is in maximizing the purely economic interest in the education. The public has a different interest. The public interest comes from providing that people have the skills sufficient to be good voters and citizens. There is no interest in funding vocational training, thereby subsidizing the industries that need the trained workers. Workers/industry should pay the full cost of their economic production. Any economic value that comes from education funding is a good side effect and should not be the target of educational policy (there may be a small second best option-type justification for funding vocational training). I will discuss this further in a later post.
