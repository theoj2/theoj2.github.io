I don't use standard WYSIWYG type word processors when it is possible to avoid them. Instead I use typesetting systems like LATEX for long documents, and plain ANSI text for shorter documents. This has three huge benefits 





1) Separation between layout and content. With a typesetting program, you just write the text and the program takes care of formatting it.   

2)Follows the UNIX philosophy. The LATEX + Typesetting system closely follows the core rule of the UNIX philosophy "_This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface._" The core of TEX is extremely small and the entire LATEX system is formed out of a set of small scripts that are built upon this. The system is extremely modular and flexible. These programs are driven by the command line. While it is impossible to use a command driven system without first learining it, it gives vast power to the user   

3)Flexibility. Due to the modular and flexible nature of LATEX the system can do almost anything. Want to properly format math equations? Sure.  Want to create a circut diagram? There is a package for that? Want to format a book so it is ready to go for Amazon's CreateSpace system?[ A package just for that](https://github.com/aginiewicz/createspace) is ready to go. I could name many other examples. This is only made possible by the code driven modular nature of a typesetting type system.   

4) Plain text is the universal system. Almost every operating system written since the 70s can edit and view plain text files. LATEX is just a plain text file of markup code.So, anything could view a document written in LATEX. Try that with Libreoffice or MS Word. 





The following article is written by someone with a similar opinion to me on this. It mostly focuses on the layout versus content issue.
