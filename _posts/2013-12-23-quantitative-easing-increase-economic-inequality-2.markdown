On a few online discussion forums I have seen the claim that the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing program increases economic inequality. This is far from the truth. Let's first discuss what the Fed is doing.QE is just an asset swap. Bondholders trade a bond for currency/reserves. The reserves pay less interest, so the wealth of their holders is actually _reduced _over the long run, but the reserves are easier to spend/more liquid. This liquidity is why bond holders are willing to make this swap.In my opinion this has little tangible economic impact, but it does serve to push long term interest down slightly.How does this affect inequality? If anything it serves to reduce it.

The wealthy hold the great majority of financial assets in the economy. Below is [a table that shows how financial assets are distributed in the United States](http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html)

These assets are generally devalued by QE, while borrowers benefit from the reduction in interest rates.Note that debt generally has a relatively even distribution. This is why QE can be expected to reduce inequality, not expand it, if there is any effect at all.
