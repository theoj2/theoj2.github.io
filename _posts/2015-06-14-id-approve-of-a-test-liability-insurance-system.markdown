I'd approve of a test/liability insurance system for gun regulation, but, only if it was part of a total redesign of the gun regulation system that took way all of the trash gun control laws. But that's not going to happen because a lot of gun control types are just like pro-lifers who realize that they can't outright ban abortion, so they just slam clinics with as much bullshit regulation as possible to make doctors' lives as hard as possible.
