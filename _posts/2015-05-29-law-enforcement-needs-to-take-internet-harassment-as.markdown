Law enforcement needs to take internet harassment as a serious crime, instead of a minor annoyance. They should actually put resources into busting the people who send death threats, and who phone in SWATings. I would rather see 10 of them get one year than one of them get 10. Because I have a feeling that the threat of getting busted will have little impact until it happens to them. And I would also bet that its an impressively small number of people responsible for most net harassment. When you read a story about a SWATer getting arrested, he did it a lot of times.
