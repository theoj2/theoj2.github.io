[**Remove Query Strings From Static Resources   

**](http://wordpress.org/plugins/remove-query-strings-from-static-resources/)





<blockquote>This plugin will remove any query strings from static resources like CSS & JS files, and will improve your speed scores in services like PageSpeed, YSlow, Pingdoom and GTmetrix.

Resources with a “?” or “&” in the URL are not cached by some proxy caching servers, and moving the query string and encode the parameters into the URL will increase your WordPress site performance grade significant. </blockquote>





**[WP Fastest Cache](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/)**





<blockquote>This plugin creates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog. When a page is rendered, php and mysql are used. Therefor, system needs RAM and CPU. If many visitors come to a site, system uses lots of RAM and CPU so page is rendered so slowly. In this case, you need a cache system not to render page again and again. Cache system generates a static html file and saves. Other users reach to static html page. </blockquote>
