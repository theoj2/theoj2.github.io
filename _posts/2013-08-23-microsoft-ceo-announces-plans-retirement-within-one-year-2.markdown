Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft for the past 13 years, [has announced](http://www.zdnet.com/heres-microsoft-ceo-ballmers-goodbye-note-to-the-troops-7000019795/) that he will retire within the next 12 months.In[ a letter](http://www.zdnet.com/heres-microsoft-ceo-ballmers-goodbye-note-to-the-troops-7000019795/) to Microsoft employees released this morning Ballmer stated that



<blockquote>_My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a devices and services company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most. We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction. _</blockquote>



Microsoft is certainly in need of a transition. According to Business Insider, Microsoft stock [has fallen](http://www.businessinsider.com/ballmer-era-stock-price-2013-8) over 40% during Ballmer's tenure.

Compare Ballmer's stock performance to that during Bill Gates' time as CEO (Ballmer started in 2000).

Microsoft's "transformation to a devices and services company" has consisted of a poorly executed imitation of Apple. This imitation is complete with [Microsoft Stores](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-microsoft-store-display,news-17421.html) and a tablet/phone operating system [no one wants to use](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmers-failures-20130823,0,2666964.story).During Ballmer's term Microsoft lost the server market to GNU/Linux based operating systems and failed to put forth a marketable alternative to Android and Apple smartphones and tablets.[According to a report released by Goldman Sachs,](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/13/windows_market_share_just_20percent/) Microsoft has fallen from almost total dominance of the computer market to just over 20% market share. As the following graph from report makes clear, this change took place almost entirely during Ballmer's tenure.

What about product quality? Well the same tribute comedian David Letterman aired after Bill Gates' retirement could very well be used to describe Microsoft under Ballmer.
