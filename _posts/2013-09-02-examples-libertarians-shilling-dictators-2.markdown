It turns out that, despite their talk of liberty, libertarians have an awfully strong tendency to support dictators. Here are five examples of prominent libertarians shilling for, or supporting, authoritarian regimes.



 
    
  1. [Lets start with what Ludwig von Mises had to say about Mussolini in his 1929 book _Liberalism_](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/11/jeer-heer-has-a-ludwig-von-mises-quote.html). "_It cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has, for the moment, saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history._ "

    
  2. [Libertarian economist Milton Friedman and his colleagues personally met with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and his policy advice became a "guiding light" for the dictator's economic policies. ](http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/11/17/the-road-from-serfdom/)After his role sparked public outrage in the United States Friedman stated that Pinochet's military dictatorship offered  "more room for individual initiative and for a private sphere of life" than the democratically elected government that preceded it.

    
  3. John Laughland, [member of the advisory board of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/25/the-ron-paul-institute-be-afraid-very-afraid.html), calls the NATO intervention against Slobodan Milosevic[ "A Totem for the New World Order" and denies that the genocide that triggered it ever took place](http://www.balkanstudies.org/articles/srebrenica-genocide-totem-new-world-order).He believes that the reason Milosevic was removed is that “Washington is promoting a system of political and military control not unlike that once practiced by the Soviet Union.”

    
  4. Lets switch from crazy uncle Ron's institute to his son. When interviewed about his opinions on the Syrian conflict [Rand Paul had this to say](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/42465_Rand_Paul-_We_Should_Leave_Assad_Alone_Because_Hes_Only_Killing_Muslims) _“I don’t see American interests involved on either side of this Syrian war. I see [Bashar] Assad, who has protected Christians for a number of decades, and Islamic rebels on the other side who have been attacking Christians_”. [Ron Paul thinks Assad may be getting set up ](http://www.salon.com/2013/08/30/ron_paul_syria_is_a_false_flag/) As a responce to the question “Oh, so you question whether Assad even used the gas, of if he’s just being set up?”, asked during an interview with Fox News. Paul responded  "_just look at how many lies were told us about Saddam Hussein prior to that buildup. More propaganda. It happens all the time. I think it’s a false flag. I think really, indeed._"

    
  5. [Libertarian commentator Lew Rockwell published ](http://www.lewrockwell.com/2012/03/marwood-dent-a-pseudonym/thoughts-on-singapore/)an article praising Singapore on his website. The article stated that "_it is a myth that democracies (read: dictatorship of the masses) by definition offer more benevolent living conditions. In my experience, democracies have seeds of self-destruction. Singapore, on the other hand, is more like a family-run corporation – a political system I prefer over democracy. Here I don’t see any busybodies around. ....They are nowhere close to an ideal government, but compared to what you get elsewhere, Singapore is a treat._ " The article then discussed the political oppression and restrictions on freedom of speech in the single party state and argues that these restrictions are good for liberty "_Quite honestly, if more freedom of speech were allowed in Singapore, it would likely also degenerate into a 'dictatorship of the mobs' in which Peter lobbies or protests to steal what is Paul’s_."
