The [previous post on #Gamergate](http://www.theojones.name/message-to-any-reasonable-people-attached-to-gamergate-you-are-scoring-a-own-goal/) got a fair amount of feedback through various sources. A few followups: 
A comment on the other post stated that the reason for the persistence of GG is because there isn't any other sources of discussion on the important issues brought up, and that attempts to create another venue have failed. The issue with this line of reasoning is that just bringing up issues isn't good enough. You actually have to convince people on them, and GG seems to be doing negative[caption id="attachment_1445" align="alignright" width="225"][![Image via Flickr user Clever Cupcakes https://flic.kr/p/7ENtyW](http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4377235346_cef76f16c6_o-225x300.jpg)](http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4377235346_cef76f16c6_o.jpg) Image via Flickr user Clever Cupcakes https://flic.kr/p/7ENtyW[/caption] publicity on these issues. The high density of problematic people associated with GG make it hard for any legitimate viewpoints presented through that banners to be heard. And GG was really doomed from the beginning when the likes of 4chan took an active role in the movement. It is very hard for a political movement to recover from a bad start and a negative reputation. And a lot of the antics associated GG have served to make things worse on many issues that GGers care about. That is a lot of the reason that I am not a GGer, I have not seen very much positive impact by GG. But I have seen a lot of negative stuff come from it, plus it is undeniable that GG has at the very least provided a flag of convenience for many trolls and sexists. I have not seen many examples where GG has done more harm than good. Take the issue of censorship. This seems to be something that most GGers will say they care about, but they have made it worse. The aftermath of GG gave the advocates of censorship a legitimate grievance to use as a casus belli and it legitimized the viewpoints of many previously insignificant activists.
