As an anti-poverty measure the minimum wage is a pretty inefficient instrument. It has a lot of economic side effects, and at high rates serves to reduce bargaining power on non-wage elements of employment due. That last fact might explain why unions are U-turning on the issue --- at least as regards to their workers.

And Warren Buffet was right to suggest an increase in the earned income tax credit as an alternative  --- although I would favor a straight basic income (the ENTC is effectively a partial basic income with a work requirement)
