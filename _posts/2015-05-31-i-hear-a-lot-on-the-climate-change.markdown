I hear a lot on the climate change issue about how technology will make adaptation much easier (usually from people who don't think drastic action should be taken on the issue). In the distant future (say, 100 years from now), to an large extent this is true. But its the close future (the next ~50 years or so) that we have to worry about. Sure, late in the 21st century or early in the 22nd century, a lot of innovations will serve to improve adaptation to climate change. Tech will decouple the economy from ecosystem services, space colonization will happen, and new, highly abundant energy sources will be developed (advanced fission reactors, fusion reactors, space-based solar). But that will take a long time to unfold, and in the meantime climate change will happen.
