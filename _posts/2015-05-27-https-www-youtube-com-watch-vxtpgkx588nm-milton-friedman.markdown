Milton Friedman discussing the possibility of a basic income/negative income tax in 1968. Don't you wish conservatives were still like this instead of like Rush Limbaugh? Probably, part of the reason why Friedman supported this is because, adopting a basic income will allow government policy that is in most other aspects much more libertarian.
