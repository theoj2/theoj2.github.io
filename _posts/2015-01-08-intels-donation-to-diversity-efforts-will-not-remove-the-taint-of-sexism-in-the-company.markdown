A few months ago Intel decided to take a pro-Gamergate stance and the company pulled advertisements from anti-Gamergate publications. It was clear to everyone (except perhaps for Intel's marketing department) that siding with a movement with a severe problem of harassment of women in the tech industry and sexism would damage the company's image. And of course, it did. [caption id="attachment_1427" align="alignright" width="300"][![Intel will sell fewer of these.

https://flic.kr/p/7xbpVv[/caption]Intel received an immediate backlash, and Intel's reputation with OEMs and consumers was damaged as a result. Through direct builds of my own and advice to friends and relatives, I was involved in a number of computer purchases since this incident. All run AMD CPUs. The Intel backing of Gamergate was a non-trivial part of this decision. Intel now has a problem, a problem that they tried to fix by throwing money at the issue. Today [Intel announced their intent to donate $300 million to tech diversity initiatives](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/intel-pledges-300-million-to-improve-diversity-in-tech/). However, this is not sufficient to relieve Intel of their issue. The fact that Intel would not only back a toxic movement such as GG, but also back one of their most toxic efforts (an attempt to retaliate against journalists who published articles that GG did not like) indicates a severe problem at Intel's culture. A problem that will take much more than money to fix, and until Intel does that, this scandal will be a black mark on the company's record.
