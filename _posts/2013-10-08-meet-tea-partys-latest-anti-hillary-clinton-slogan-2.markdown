A group at a California GOP convention [decided to distribute buttons](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/05/hillary-clinton-buttons_n_4051545.html) with the following slogan.



<blockquote>KFC Hillary Special, 2 fat thighs, 2 small breasts …. left wing.</blockquote>



A tweet from a San Francisco Chronicle journalist indicates that the buttons were popular.



<blockquote>Popular buttons at [@CAGOP](https://twitter.com/CAGOP) convention already take on [@hillaryclinton](https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton) #2016 in a big way... Ouch!! [pic.twitter.com/3SdIqZs7GG](http://t.co/3SdIqZs7GG)

Is "hurk.. hurk.. small boobs" really the best criticism of a politician with decades of experience at the highest levels of government the Tea Party and the Republicans can come up with? If they don't their next Presidential primary to become another clown car they should hope not. This type of garbage drives out every person with reasonable criticisms of Clinton's policy proposals and serves to paint the entire GOP as a bunch of cavemen, thereby becoming the best Clinton advertisement money can buy.
