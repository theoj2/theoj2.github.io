  1. Produce a distributed hash table (CAN?)

    
  2. Each member of the table should be one unit of the currency. The key of this unit can be anything that is not taken by another node.

    
  3. The value should consist of two items. The first should be a partial hash collision of the key. The second should be the public key of the owner of the digital coin.

    
  4. The coins can be transferred by sending the nodes a message signed by the private key stored in the node, and containing the new public key.
