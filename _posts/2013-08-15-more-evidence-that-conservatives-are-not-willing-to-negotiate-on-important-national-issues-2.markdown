Barack Obama wants to do to this country” (More of her statements below the "Read More" button).What does that mean? [NO to](http://mediamatters.org/video/2013/06/07/laura-ingraham-vows-to-campaign-against-any-hou/194381) a responsible immigration policy. [NO to a responsible decision on the debt ceiling ](https://theojones.name/index.php/debt-ceiling-shakedown-2013/)and NO to a responsible health care policy.

NO [to a responsible monetary policy](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/rand-paul-loves-milton-friedman-but-milton-friedman-would-have-hated-rand-paul/278589/). Rand Paul can't even suggest a pick for the FED chair who [is actually alive](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-12/rand-pauls-pick-for-the-fed).
