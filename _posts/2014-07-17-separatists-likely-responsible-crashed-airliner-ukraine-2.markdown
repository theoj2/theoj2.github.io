[A passenger jet crashed](http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/17/world/europe/ukraine-malaysia-airlines-crash/index.html?hpt=hp_t1) in eastern Ukraine today with 295 deaths, most likely due to a missile strike. The Ukrainian government has already blamed the attack on separatists that it identifies as terrorists. There is strong evidence to back up the Kiev's claim. Kiev also claims direct Russian military involvement in the incident. The separatists have seized 9K37 Buk-M1 missile systems and [have already used these to shoot down military aircraft](http://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-separatists-have-shot-down-multiple-aircraft-over-the-past-month-2014-7). Eyewitness accounts[ provide evidence](http://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/2ayy7e/buk_in_snizhne_today/) that these were deployed near where the airliner crashed.[ Buk-M1 missiles are consistent](http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/17/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-crash-missile/index.html?iid=article_sidebar) with the airliner's flight-path, altitude, and the damage done. Because the separatists lack aircraft the Ukrainian army would be unlikely to widely deploy anti-aircraft missiles. Further evidence of separatist involvement comes from the fact that separatist forces quickly seized the flight data recorder of the airliner and are in progress of transporting it to Russia. Recordings and online discussions from the separatists seems to also confirm their responsibility.

[The following photo](http://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/2ayy7e/buk_in_snizhne_today/) (via a Ukranian Reddit user) shows a Buk-M1 launcher in Snizhne, a city near the crash site.   

   

[Other accounts](http://ukrain.bazaza.net/207606/) seem to confirm the presence of Buk-M1 launchers in Snizhne. Before the airliner was hit, the separatists pledged to [use the Buk-M1 launchers to protect their airspace](http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1741703).

[A statement by Ukraine's Foreign Ministry](http://abcnews.go.com/International/malaysian-air-loses-contact-passenger-plane-ukraine/story?id=24599558) describes the following details about the crash.



<blockquote>According to the General Staff of Ukrainian Armed Forces, the airplane was shot down by the Russian Buk missile system as the liner was flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters. Ukraine has no long-range air defense missile systems in this area. The plane was shot down, because the Russian air defense systems was affording protection to Russian mercenaries and terrorists in this area. Ukraine will present the evidence of Russian military involvement into the Boeing crash.</blockquote>



Ukraine's Security Service posted but later removed a intercepted intercepted phone call that [seems to indicate separatist involvement](http://web.archive.org/web/20150613142805/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skL_1RcLRCA).

A translated transcript of the discussion [can be found in this forum discussion](http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=27230025#p27230025).

Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, a top commander of the sepratist forces took responsibility for downing the plane when he was still under the impression that it was Ukrainian saying, "We warned - do not fly in our skies".
