Peter Schiff is a libertarian talkshow host who promotes dubious predictions of imminent hyperinflation -- predictions which never seem to materialize. Well it turns out that [he showed up at a Wallmart protest and disrupted](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/21/1264469/-Millionaire-Oligarch-Poses-as-Walmart-Protestor-Harrasses-Shoppers-to-Discredit-Mock-Employees) it.Â Schiff released the following video  







He claimed to be a Wallmart worker and harassed shoppers and requested that they give him 15% of what they spent at the store. He held signs that stated "15 for 15 contributions" and mocked shoppers who said they didn't have the money. He shouted the slogans "higher prices for higher wages" and "We are counting on you to pay higher prices!"
