Curtis Yarvin is a software engineer who researches distributed computing methods. [He also authors ](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/)[political writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug](http://moldbuggery.blogspot.com/). Yarvin's political views are very problematic by any account. He describes his views as "reactionary" and believes that democracy is a mistake and that the optimal form of government is absolute monarchy. There is also a strong dose of sexism and racism in his political writings. One could get the feeling that a person with Yarvin's views would be sympathetic to the claim that Saudi Arabia is the greatest country in the world (although, to be clear here, Yarvin has never said so). In his professional career, he is currently working on [Urbit](http://popehat.com/2013/12/06/nock-hoon-etc-for-non-vulcans-why-urbit-matters/), a distributed computing system. Yarvin was scheduled to speak at the [Strange Loop ](https://thestrangeloop.com/about.html) information technology conference on the subject of Urbit. The talk was not political in nature. Even if Yarvin's political writing is wrongheaded, Urbit seems to be worthy scientific and technical work. However, the conference organizers withdrew his speaking spot after becoming aware of his political writings. This in my opinion is quite wrong headed. By all means, if Yarvin tried to turn the conference into a Klan rally, the organizers ought to act. But as far as I can tell that's not what was happening. The questions of whether monarchies are a good idea, or if Urbit is a reasonable approach to distributed computing are unrelated. To reject a bit of scientific work because of its author is an ad hominem attack in simple form. One can easily have [idiotic ideas in one field and brilliant ideas in another](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nobel_disease). Society does not benefit in any meaningful way when a good idea is lost because of politics. And an even worse possibility is that this type of thing will spread to mainline political views. A world where academics are forced to refrain from political activism for the sake of career advancement would not be a good one. It would be the spread And as legal blogger [Clark Bianco points out this ](http://popehat.com/2015/06/10/two-kinds-of-freedom-of-speech-or-strangeloop-vs-curtis-yarvin/#comments)type of thing reflects a general turning away from freedom of speech in the political discourse, "_freedom of speech is not merely a legal issue centering on the first amendment, but also a cultural issue, centering on our willingness to tolerate the presence and the words of those we disagree with_".
